# Programmable Gain Aamplifier (PGA) Circuits Design

This project focuses on designing the schematics and layouts of PGA circuits using electronic components from the UMC65II library, implemented in Cadence Virtuoso. The key components implemeneted include:
* Inverter
* Operational amplifier
* CMOS switch
* Low-pass filter
* Multiplexer

For each component, both schematic and layout designs are provided, along with testbenches to ensure that the design requirements are met. After intergating all components into the completet PGA layout, all design requirements are satisfied.

## Overview

The PGA is a circuit used as part of an audio amplifier. It adjusts the input signal's amplitude and includes a low pass filter to reduce the effects of noise.
